We changed the game to be in a while loop, waiting for either a winner or a stalemate to make it easier to test for both of those conditions. We also added a test for stalemates also ensuring the game ends with it. Instead of outputing and getting inputs inside a function we moved it to the main, and changed the prompt_move to validate_move. This validate_move functions allows for us to test the placements on the board better than before ensuring the function and place_maker function are working. We are now able to test edge cases faster than before with the new functions.
