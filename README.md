# My final project for UNR CS 333
I am taking activity 3 Tic Tac Toe code and rebuilding for the final project. I've combined both the activity 3 code and testing with an old tic tac toe python project I built in another class. This final project now has both a tic tac toe game along with the testing idea for CS 333.

# How to install and run
Ensure you have docker installed on your computer. Then, open a command prompt and run these commands:
